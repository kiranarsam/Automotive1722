# AutomotiveOpen1722
Working applications with IEEE1722 protocol using [Open1722](https://github.com/COVESA/Open1722) framework.

## Introduction

AutomotiveOpen1722 is a fork of [Open1722](https://github.com/COVESA/Open1722) and also fork of [AVNU/libavtp](https://github.com/Avnu/libavtp) which is an open source reference implementation of the Audio Video Transport Protocol (AVTP) specified in IEEE 1722-2016 spec. _libavtp_ primarily focuses on audio video data formats of the IEEE 1722-2016 spec.

IEEE 1722 is also gaining a lot of traction in the automotive community, mainly, to bridge fieldbus technologies over automotive Ethernet. In particular the AVTP Control Formats (ACF) specify serialization for a set of data formats relevant for automotive applications (e.g., CAN, LIN, etc.).

AutomtiveOpen1722 uses Open1722 APIs to standard working applications.
Currentl application development:
* CAN over IEEE1722

NOTE: AutomotiveOpen1722 is currently incubating and under active development for standard working applications in Linux environment.
