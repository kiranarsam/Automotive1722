$ nvm current # Should print "v22.14.0".
```

```

# vehicle-app
Inside that directory, you can run several commands:

## Starts the development server.
```bash
  $ npm start
```
## Bundles the app into static files for production.
```bash
  $ npm run build
```
## Starts the test runner.
```bash

Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you canâ€™t go back!
```bash
  $ npm run eject
```

We suggest that you begin by typing:

```bash
  $ cd vehicle-app
  $ npm start
```
